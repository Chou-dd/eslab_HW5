When you clone the code, it may not be runned successfully.
This is because some of the files had changed the format when we upload them to github.
If this happens, you can use the project in https://os.mbed.com/teams/mbed-os-examples/code/mbed-os-example-ble-Button/
Replace the main.cpp and ButtonService.h with our main.cpp and ButtonService.h in source file.
Then add LEDService.h in our source file to its source file.
